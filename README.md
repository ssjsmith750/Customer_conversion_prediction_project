Classification Problem


This project aims to predict the class of a given set of observations using various machine learning algorithms. The problem is a classification problem, where the target variable is a   binary categorical variable 

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a cleaned and preprocessed. The preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical variables
Balancing the data to account for class imbalance
The final dataset has N observations and M features.

Algorithms
The following algorithms were used for training and testing the model:

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

XG Boost

The models were evaluated using cross-validation and the performance metrics used were accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results
The results of the model performance are summarized  below:

Logistic Regression - AUROC Score is 0.85

KNN - AUROC Score is 0.888

Decision Tree - AUROC Score is 0.893

XG Boost - AUROC Score is 0.899

Random Forest - AUROC Score is 0.903

Hence Random Forest is giving the good AUROC Score of 0.903
Based on the results, we can see that the Random Forest algorithm had the highest overall performance with an accuracy of 0.85 and an F1 score of 0.903

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully tackled a classification problem by preprocessing the data and testing various machine learning algorithms. Based on the results, we can see that the Random Forest algorithm is the most suitable algorithm for this problem.
